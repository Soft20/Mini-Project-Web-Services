## Objectives
The task is to create an application, which takes use of web services.
The application has minimum three components:
- [x] SOAP service
- [x] RESTful service
- [x] Client application, which consumes the services.

At least one of the web services, as well as the web services consumer must be originally developed by you/your team, while the others can be requested from public sources.

Deploy the application on either a local or a remote server.
Prepare demonstration of the implementation.

## Technical Features
### Summary
This project consist of a REST server written in TypeScript, and a client written in python.

The client uses our own REST Web Service and an external SOAP Web Service. The client can request different calculation operations to both services, where both response with and answer.

The REST Service also returns a list of all available urls as an attribute called `links`.

We selected Python and TypeScript to show the usage and integration between multiple programing languages. 


### Business Case
Our business case is to create two calculator services, the first using SOAP and second using REST.

The client has the option to select the type of service through the terminal, followed by selecting the operation type, and the values needed for the calculation.

The following operations are available:
* `Add`
* `Subtract`
* `Multiply`
* `Divide`

As an extension our REST service provides an endpoint for making CRUD operations for handling your favorite number. This is done by using the URI: `\favorite` with the http methods `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` & `DELETE`.

### RESTfulness

#### Architectural Constraints

- [x] Client-server architecture  
Server and client are separated and connected with the servers api.

- [x] Statelessness  
The server is stateless, the client cant store any content the server. Our server uses a json file as a proxy database to avoid storing content on the server.

- [x] Cacheability  
This can be obtained though the response header `Cache-control`.

- [x] Layered system  
Not a part of our business case, the could be solve by calling the SOAP service through our own server. This helps the consumer by only using one web service.

- [ ] Code on demand (optional)  
_Not a part of our business case._

##### Uniform interface
- [x] Resource identification in requests  
Our URIs identifies the targeted resource.

- [x] Resource manipulation through representations  
Our `/favorite` uri consist of the four CRUD operations as http methods `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` & `DELETE`.

- [x] Self-descriptive messages  
For each response a Self-descriptive message is provided to the client for better understanding.

- [x] Hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS)  
Our response contains a list called `_links` containing available URIs. Our use case wasn't the best for showing the feature. A better use case could be a movie service, where a movies could link to the actors in it, and actors could link to the movies they have acted in.

_HATEOAS example_
```typescript
response = {
    // response body...

    _links = {
        favorite: [
            { href: '/favorite', rel: 'Get favorite number', method: 'GET' },
            { href: '/favorite', rel: 'Create favorite number', method: 'POST' },
            { href: '/favorite', rel: 'Update favorite number', method: 'PUT' },
            { href: '/favorite', rel: 'Delete favorite number', method: 'DELETE' },
        ],

        calculator: [
            { href: '/add', rel: 'Number addition', method: 'POST' },
            { href: '/subtract', rel: 'Number subtraction', method: 'POST' },
            { href: '/multiply', rel: 'Number multiplication', method: 'POST' },
            { href: '/divide', rel: 'Number division', method: 'POST' },
        ],
    }
};
```


## Prerequisite

#### Server
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn)

`Node.js` comes with a package manager called `npm`, we uses a optimized version called `yarn` which can be installed uses `npm` as seen below.

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

#### Client
* [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Installation
#### Server
```bash
yarn install
```

#### Client
[inquirer](https://pypi.org/project/inquirer/)
```bash
pip install inquirer
```

[beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)
```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

[lxml](https://pypi.org/project/lxml/)
```bash
pip install lxml
```

## Execution
`ctr + c` to terminate services.

#### Server
```bash
yarn start
```

#### Client
```bash
python src/client/app.py
```
