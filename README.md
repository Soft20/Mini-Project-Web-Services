## Objectives
The task is to create an application, which takes use of web services.
The application has minimum three components:
- [ ] SOAP service
- [ ] RESTful service
- [ ] Client application, which consumes the services.

At least one of the web services, as well as the web services consumer must be originally developed by you/your team, while the others can be requested from public sources.

Deploy the application on either a local or a remote server.
Prepare demonstration of the implementation.
